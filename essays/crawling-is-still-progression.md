I previously had experience with Java, Python, and C++. So far, I have really enjoyed JavaScript. I much prefer it over Java, due to the easier parameter passing abilities. Java is much more "hard coded" and requires a lot more specifics in order to compile and run. I really enjoyed the JavaScript modules because it reminds me of the DataCamp and CodeAcademy modules.
I've done quite a few those and had a lot of fun. They're much more interactive than simply sitting in a lecture and watching someone write a bit of code. 
I also enjoyed the fact that the questions are relatively short. I felt like I was making a lot more progress than I really was, but it made me feel much more motivated.
The WODs (Workout of the Day) have been a great experience in solving quickly during a stressful situation. I will certainly admit, I am not good at coding interiews. I am the type of coder who much prefers to write a bit, go out to lunch, come back and write a bit more, and then maybe finish it next week. 
I have never been the type to sit down and do things all in one go, especially against a time limit. It causes me a great deal of stress and I blank out. 
Suddenly, I can't remeber anything from the modules or how to even print a line to the screen. All I can think about is "I have fifteen minutes only". 
 Having said that, I believe with more practice I will get used to that feeling and natually overcome it. I recently became an ATA for the intoduction to Java classes at my university. As I've been helping students, I have had flashbacks to my own time in those classes. 
Java is a very frustrating programming language. It's much more diffult to use and understand than python or JavaScript. Although I disliked every second of it, I'm glad my first learned programming language was Java. Learning programming simply gets easier after that. 

Overall, I can't wait to do projects with JavaScript and apply more of my freshly learned skills. As they say, crawling is still progression.
