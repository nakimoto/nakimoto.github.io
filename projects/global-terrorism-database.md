# Project Background
**The Global Terrorism Database** is a collection of *190,000+* terrorist events from around the world. This collection spans from **1970** through **2018**. 
This database is compiled by a large team of researchers and is available to the public for access. The original file is in an excel spreadsheet and can be exported to other file types (or implemented into a workable database). 

# Project Goals 
- Download and study the information on the global terrorism database
- Choose a focus area for data collection and analytics processing
- Export data into local database
- Overlay data onto arcGIS maps for better data visualization
-

# Project Notes
I used SQL to create a smaller scale database that showcased connections between terrorist events in specific areas. 
I specicially isolated certain events in New York before and after the 9/11 terror attacks to showcase the change in the geopolitcal climate as well as the response. I also turned my attention to a few places that have been politically unstable recently, such as Ukraine. I was able to link events in Ukraine that eventually led to the annexation of Crimea as well as the pro-Russian takeover of Donetsk and Luhansk. When I placed my data collection of events surrounding these time frames, the connection and eventual prediction became clear.
