# Project Background
This project was created to solve a problem fro university students. As we all know, the university student budget is very small. Many students
struggle to find afforable and easy to make recipes with the appliances they have available. We wanted to create an application that would allow students to post and favorite
recipes by the community. Students would be able to specify ingredients, cook and preperation time, appliances used, and dietary restrictions. 
Students can browse recipes from breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, and dessert. 
We also have a "recipes of the week" section on the home page, and a place to view some of the developers' favorite vendors. Students can also leave comments about those vendors.
This application does require an account to see anything beyond the landing page. There admin features that allow the administrator to add new vendors and see all recipes currently hosted.

# Individual Project Goals
This project was split into three milestones as part of the project planning process. For **milestone one**, I handled all of the project write-up in the homepage and a few of the
components. I also handled assigning issues. 
For **milestone two**, I began implementing continuous integration and testing via testcafe. This testing requires the creation of testing pages and ID's from specifc elements
must match in order for the testcontroller to properly execute. The homepage contains a digital pasge that shocases current testing results. During this time, I began including a user guide and developer guide into the homepage. I also assigned
new issues to the team. 
Finally, during **milestone three** I implemented more testing (a total of thirteen pages), updated the homepage to include an in-depth user guide and administrator 
guide. I made a few CSS changes and removed unnecessary files from the underlying applicaiton template. The testing is very time consuming and required me to wait for the rest of my time to finish any assigned pages. The reason for this is because testing is reliant on
ID values matching. One of the lessons I learning from our second milestone is that it doesn't work to do it as you go along, it's better to wait for everyone else to be finished
with their changes to ensure testing will continue to work. 

# Project Conclusion
Working in teams always comes with some frustration in terms of structuring, planning, and meeting. Our team utilized a divide and conquer method where we assigned a member to
a certain aspect of the project, and they would handle all issues relating to that aspect (usually). This is why I handled the same area issues for each milestone. This saved us a lot of time 
and irritation, otherwise we would all be wondering what the previous member did and there would be a lot of overlap. This method works really well and I felt that it kept our debugging time
to a minimum. 

Our team utilized discord for communication. We relied a lot more on text chat because it meant we could automatically keep a record of what we were previously talking about. 
All of our ideas, photos, links, etc., would be available to go back and look at. 

I learned a lot about project planning from this experience. It's incredibly important to plan the steps of your project, and also plan for possible issues. I found it was helpful
to have backup ideas for certain components or ideas. In the event something doesn't work out, you've already got something else to implement in its place. 
In our last milestone, we incorporated a soft deadline, hard deadline, and the official deadline. We se tthe soft deadline for five days before the official. During this deadline we 
would have finished all of our major changes and edits. At this time we would choose to revise small things or implement new things in the remainder of our time. 
The hard deadline would be two days before the official and would indicate all debugging and small changes were done. After this deadline, nothing can be changed besides appearance (CSS) related aspects. The time
between hard deadline and official deadline is reserved for testing. We did end up making small CSS changes continuously into the final day, but going forward I would not recommend that.
