>Software engineering has always been a neutral topic for me. I much prefer the mathematical side of computer science, rather than the *"designing webpages and applications"* side. My mind and heart definitely lie on **quantum computing, artificial intelligence,** and **robotics**. However, it's important to understand how central basic software engineering skills are to your career as a computer scientist. In the same way that discrete mathematics discribes the foundations of CS, software engineering shows you the why and the how.

>I hope I continue developing a greater interest in software engineering, as well as shaping my skills in this particular subset. 
I would really like to better my understanding of software engineering concepts and how to develop my own projects. I have a lot of ideas for projects but I don't know enough to properly execute them. I keep a list of small little ideas for projects and it has been gathering digital dust, unfortunately. I hope to cross many of these off with learning more techniques and gaining more free time.

>It's a little silly, but I used to have an idea for an app that would help owners of overweight cats. It would be a small interactive app that would
show tips for getting your cat to eat less and move more. You could track your cat's weight, eating habits, and sleeping habits. There would even be a 
section titled "**Cat Aerobics**" where owners could do aerobics with their feline friend. Could you imagine? An app with an aerobic dance along
that encourages you and your cat to stay healthy? The cat has no idea what is even being said. A strange idea but a long, (and not so lost!), dream of mine.
