>As most early (and veteran!) software developers know, StackOverflow is the go-to for all software engineering related questions. It's a tried and true staple
in the community. StackOverflow is a forum-like website that allows users to ask specific questions and get advice from more veteran developers.
Although many people argue that there are no stupid questions, there are certainly questions that could be *smarter*. Is there a specifc way we should all be
questions? As it turns out, there is! 
>Eric Raymond created a series of guidelines to help formulate smart questions, in order to get a truly useful answer. As I read through these guidelines, I
thought about the many times I may have asked a question in this same fashion. You never think about how you ask questions in a way that would get you a great response. 
According to Eric's guidelines, some examples of not-so-smart questions include the following:

>1.Posting your question in the wrong area of a forum or website
2. Posting a simple question in an area designated for more advanced needs
3. Cross-posting to various forums or websites
4. Emailing someone whom you don't have a pre-existing relationship with
