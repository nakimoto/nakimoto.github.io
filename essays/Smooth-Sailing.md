**Semantic UI** is a wonderful resource that allows for a seamless creation of webpages using *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*. During my time using it and learning the ins and outs of it all, I came to really enjoy the idea of making webpages. I never considered taking it up as a skill or even a hobby in the past, but I definitely plan to now. It's a great way to use your artistic and creative sense in website development. 

Having said that, boy is it frustrating! I spend so much time trying to figure out why my text isn't centered, why my images aren't showing up, why things are shifted to the left, etc. Finding the problem is often easy, but solving it is something else entirely! Like a programming language, one small character in the wrong place can change a lot.
