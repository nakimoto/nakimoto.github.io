# Becoming a Senior Citizen...of my University

As I'm getting closer and closer to graduating with my bachelor's degree in computer science, I've learned to refine my coding a lot more. I was lucky that in the beginning of my college degree, 
the professors I had for my introductory coding classes were quite strict on coding standards. By that, I mean we needed to have the code follow a specific styling. We needed to properly indent lines, 
space out methods, comment each function, include comments at the top with an appropriate description, date, author, and other important factors. At times, it seemed meticulous, but it was incredible necessary.
This practice has helped me significantly as I moved up to upper division classes as well as in my personal work. Earlier this year, I started using the ESLint tool in IntelliJ that helped me 
follow coding standards, and it has been a lifesaver. I was a bit familiar with these sort of tools because I had used checkstyle in Jgrasp which does the same thing. 

I also became an assistant TA this semester for Introduction to JAVA I and II. One of the most important things I stressed to incoming students was commenting your code and following a common style. The reason
why this is important is because others will absolutely read your code. You will also revisit your own code and if you have no idea what was going on, what needed to be debugged, etc., it becomes of no use.
In terms of software development, it's absolutely good practice to comment your code and aexplain the program and its intentions thoroughly. If a senior dev needs to look at your code the last thing they want to do
is have to ask you what it actually is supposed to do and what doesn't actually work. This can waste a lot of time, and debugging takes *a lot* of time. 

While finishing up the semester of tutoring, I unforunately ran into many students who shared code or copied and pasted from websites. They didn't really understand why they should not be doing that (regardless of academic dishonesty).
It got me thinking about the ethics of computing.

# Break Into my Home? Well, You're no Longer Welcome!!
I recently read a story about a group of researchers who got the University of Minnesota banned from interacting with Linux after they sent faulty patches through the system. 
Their initial plan was to test the open source software by sending these patches and testing out whether they were caught by the moderating team or the system itself. 
After this came to light, the Linux community were incredibly upset. The researcher's claimed that they couldn't ask anyone for permission because the results would no longer 
be blind, since at least one individual would have known to look out for them. On the surface level, one might believe their intentions were good. However, 
it was a crash course in computing (and open-source software) ethics. 

Open-source software is described as software that is open for anyone to contribute to. Meaning, the community itself are developers who contantly push updates or patches
to the system. The success of open-source is heavily reliant on the dedicated community members who keep the software up to date and handle bugs or security issues. Most of this community base
consist of people with some developer background whther it's by profession or hobby. This information is important when considering the backlash the researchers recieved from this very same community.

A few times a year, a celebrity or youtuber gets their accounts hacked and the hacker may say something such as don't worry just testing your security" but it was without
the individual's consent! The behave as if you should be grateful. Think of it like if someone kicked in your door and walked around your home. Maybe they didn't take anything but they leave a note on the table
that says "don't worry but you should have a stronger door"...you wouldn't exactly feel grateful. In fact, you would prbbaly feel violated. 
Now, it is true that some companies will hire hackers to test their cyber security, but the difference is the consent to the act and previous knowledge of what it happening. 

# The Ethics of Your Job
When it comes to the researchers, the Linux community did not feel grateful and did in fact, feel violated. The reason why lies in computing ethics. ACM, or the Association for Computing and Machinery, 
has a specific set of guidelines that most of the computing world aim to follow (View these [Here](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)). These guidelines encompass general ideas involving ethical behavior when dealing with software. 
Upon my own investigation of these guidelines, here are a few that I feel the researchers violated: 

>1.3 (Be honest and trustworthy)

>3.7 (Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society)

>2.2 (Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice)

>2.3 (Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work)

I took a class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa entitled "Computing Ethics" (ICS 390) in which I learned a whole lot about the considerations that must be made in the 
ever-growing digital world. There were a specific series of philosophical perspectives in which these ACM guidelines appear to span across. Reading about all of these ethics and rules
and unhappy developers made me think about the small choices we make every day involving computer science. I started to think more about who harvests my data, who buys it, what do they do with it, 
do I have any choice, etc. What is the "social contract" between an individual and their technology? Personally, I can't see the researchers' perspective at all in the situation I mentioned above, because the social contract between them and the open-source community
was broken. 

# Progression 

Apple recently released a new version of iOS that requires applications to ask whether you would like them to track you and your information. In their own words:

> *"Starting with iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and tvOS 14.5, you’ll need to receive the user’s permission through the AppTrackingTransparency framework to track them or access their device’s advertising identifier. Tracking refers to the act of linking user or device data collected from your app with user or device data collected from other companies’ apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. Tracking also refers to sharing user or device data with data brokers."* (You can read the full user privacy and data use section [here](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/).)

I have absolutely not allowed apps to track me after this function was released. Facebook (and sister site *Instagram*), a site that is known for its severe data leaks, is now taking Apple to court claiming this new feature will bankrupt them because they can no longer personally advertise to individuals without their consent. My opinion on Facebook is already low, so low in fact it's beneath the Earth's crust, but it really showed me how valuable personal data is for companies in this digital age. There was a politician a while back that pushed for this idea that your personal data is worth money and that harvesting it would require monetary payment, regardless of access to a device or other technology you seemingly get for free. I begin to wonder if data harvesting is really ethical or have we all just agreed that its a "necesarry evil" in order to keep our beloved social media services. At what point do the cons outweigh the pros?
