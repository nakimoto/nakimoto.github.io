# Project Background
The overall goal for this project was to develop landers and rovers that would efficiently use limited resources to find water on mars. I was part of team 45 that 
consisted of students from Hawaii and one student from Alaska. We had computer science, electrical engineering, (2) mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, 
and chemistry. 

# Individual Project Goals
My job was to plan out the robotics and simple algorithms that would be used in order to retrieve data from Mars' top soil. I also did a lot of research using the [JMARS](https://jmars.asu.edu) software. This software has many different project planning capabilities including the ability to look at the surface of certain interstellar objects. I was searching for places that would be ideal landing locations.

# Overall
The project took us about four months to complete. Our team held bi-weekly meetings and kept thorough logs of our work in gantt charts. At the end of the project we wrote a 70-page project thesis on why and how our system of landers and rovers would work. This experience taught me how to work well in teams as well as good project planning and coordination.
