**Semantic UI** is a wonderful resource that allows for a seamless creation of webpages using *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*. During my time using it and learning the ins and outs of it all, I came to really enjoy the idea of making webpages. I never considered taking it up as a skill or even a hobby in the past, but I definitely plan to now. It's a great way to use your artistic and creative sense in website development. 

Over the last few months, I've began to utilize semantic UI in small-scale projects like building a locally hosted site to store files with data I scraped from HTMl sites. I found myself automatically thinking about using it to give a more user-friendly experience, despite the user mainly being me. Designing web pages has made me understand the importance in user feedback and user accessibility. Not only do you want your site to be eye-catching, but you also want it to have the necessary features in an easy to find place for everyone. Your site shouldn't be difficult to navigate or hard to follow along. Now when I am making a website, I think about websites I visit frequanelty and what their stragies are to engage the user straight from the landing page. Color blocking, bolded headers, informational footers, and dropdown menus with the indicating arrows are just some of things I've noticed. 

Of course, I also think about websites I've had the ultimately displeasure of using. These sites (that shall remain a secret) are usually small websites that are built for local car dealerships or restaurants. They often have broken links, strangely colored text, uncentered images, and terrible accessibility options. 

Having said that, boy is it all frustrating! I spend so much time trying to figure out why my text isn't centered, why my images aren't showing up, why things are shifted to the left, etc. Finding the problem is often easy, but solving it is something else entirely! Like a programming language, one small character in the wrong place can change a lot.
