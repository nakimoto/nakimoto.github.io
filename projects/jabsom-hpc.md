summary: I built and HPC for the biosciences lab at JABSOM. 
---
In the summer of 2020 I started working at the Biosciences lab at John A. Burns School of Medicine as an udergraduate research assistant. We worked on building an HPC for
the lab to use, in order to process high quality imaging data more efficiently. We put together several servers and I installed Centos, gulp, and slurm on them. 
I also upgraded all the hard drives as well as the ram. We had sixteen servers all with 320gb of ram and twenty four terabytes of storage each. 
I named the HPC "Bubbles"!
