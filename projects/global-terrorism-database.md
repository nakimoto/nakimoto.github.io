summary: I used the Global Terrorism Database to showcase how looking at data points from the past, could help to predict the future.

The Global Terrorism Database is a collection of 190,000+ terrorist events from around the world. This collection spans from 1970 through 2018. 
I used SQL to create a smaller scale database that showcased connections between terrorist events in specific areas. 
For example, I was able to link events in Ukraine that eventually led to the annexation of Crimea as well as the pro-Russian takeover of Donetsk and Luhansk.
