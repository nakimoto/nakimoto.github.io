# Project Background
In the summer of 2020 I started working at the **Biosciences Expmed lab** at **John A. Burns School of Medicine** as an udergraduate research assistant. I worked on building an HPC for the lab to use, in order to process high quality imaging data more efficiently. I put together several servers and I installed *Centos*, *gulp*, and *slurm* on them. We used recycled servers from old offices and used parts ordered from various websites. The process took me about six weeks. 

I also upgraded all the hard drives as well as the ram. We had sixteen servers all with 320gb of ram and twenty-four terabytes of storage each.

After it was all said and done, I named the frankenstein HPC "**Bubbles**"!

# Problem Solving
While working on Bubbles, the biggest problems I ran into involved dealing with the ram upgrades. Ram slots are very sensitive and it is very easy to break the snaps that hold them in place, bend prongs, and scrape chips. Every time the ram is physically manipulated, it would cause the HPC to go into a boot loop or refuse to recognize the chips at all. It's best to spend a lot of time being delicate about the process. 

Working with centos and redhat linux was a little troublesome from time to time because of certain security worries that would stop me from installing certain things. 

# Future Use 
Bubbles will be used to high quality image and data processing by the laboratory. Upgrading the GPU and monitor is in the near future.
