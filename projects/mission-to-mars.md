summary: I was part of the NASA L'SPACE Academy project to build landers and rovers for a theoretical mission to mars.

>The overall goal for this project was to develop landers and rovers that would efficiently use limited resources to find water on mars. I was part of team 45 that 
consisted of students from Hawaii and one student from Alaska. We had computer science, electrical engineering, (2) mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, 
and chemistry. It was a really great team of diverse study areas. At the end of the project we wrote a 70-page project thesis on everything. 
My job was to plan out the robotics and simple algorithms that would be used in order to retrieve data from Mars' top soil.
