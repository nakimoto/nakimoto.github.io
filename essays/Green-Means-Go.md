>>It's a green light for go! 
Throughout my journey coding, one of my favorite things has always been messing with the configurations of programs. When I was learning Java, I used JGrasp. JGrasp
has a wonderful tool called checkstyle which is a way to keep up coding standards. Personally, coding standards are something I recommend everyone apply to their projects. 
The benefit of having your code be more readable and flow in a common way definitely outweighs the irritance of having to adjust everything. 
I remember using checkstyle in my first semester and having dozens of errors for thing slike white spaces, brack placement, lack of javadoc comments, etc. I felt so annoyed
because if my code did what it was supposed to do, why was this necessary? 
Nevertheless, I really came to enjoy it. Eventually, you learn to code in alignment with the standards. Towards the end of my Java journey (in class anyways) I didn't get 
checkstyle errors anymore. That was simply the way that I coded. 
I carried that style when I learned C and entered everything on command line and edited things in emacs. 

>>While using ESLint in Javascript, I haven't been bothered by it at all. I think it's really helpful. I feel like it cuts my time debugging. 
When i think back to Java, I would have to manually run checkstyle and check the console for the errors, then go line-by-line fixing them. With ESLint, it tells me in real time. 
I must prefer that method because I can adjust as I go. 
Regarding coding standards, I have also always commented my code a lot. I recently became an ATA for Into to Java and I noticed many students don't comment their code well. 
Although it's a beginner class, it's a good habit to form. I always recommend it to them so they can go back and understand what each step in their code does. 
It is also important so someone else who is reviewing their code can understand it. 

>>I've never been one to follow a rubric, but coding standards is always something I try to follow.
