# Oh, how nice it would be! to have a blueprint of life. 
 Do you ever find yourself listening to a friend's problems, only to realise that you've worn their shoes before? You start to give them advice on what you did to 
 to handle the situation. Maybe you even write down some of your most promised solutions for them to use whenever they need. Your friend shares your gread ideas with 
 another friend, who shares it with another friend, and so on. Soon, your solutions become a blueprint for similar problem solving between a group of mutual friends.
