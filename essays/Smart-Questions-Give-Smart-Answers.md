# Guidelines for Recieving Smart Answers

As most software developers know, StackOverflow is the go-to for all software engineering related questions. It's a tried and true staple
in the community. StackOverflow is a forum-like website that allows users to ask specific questions and get advice from more veteran developers.
Although many people argue that there are no stupid questions, there are certainly questions that could be *smarter*. Is there a specifc way we should all be
questions? As it turns out, there is! 

Software developer *Eric Raymond* created a series of guidelines to help formulate smart questions in order to get a truly useful answer. As I read through these guidelines, I thought about how I would formulate my questions about anything in the past. How many of those questions were actually...stupid? Or rather, how many of them were not very smart in getting me the answers I really needed? 

### According to Eric's guidelines, here are some examples of not-so-smart questions:

>1. Posting your question in the wrong area of a forum or website
>2. Posting a simple question in an area designated for more advanced needs
>3. Cross-posting to various forums or websites
>4. Emailing someone whom you don't have a pre-existing relationship with 

# What's a Not-So-Smart Question? Let's Look at an Example.

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32547805/any-way-to-make-mysql-not-freeze-my-computer) is an example of a stupid question. In this post on StackOverflow, a user asks how to stop MySQL from freezing their computer.
The only details they give about it don't include the hardware details. The user doesn't mention what brand of computer, year, device type, or even operating system! As you scroll through this page, you will notice a user asking for the original poster's server specifications. 
When you don't include important details like that, it makes it more likely that someone will simply pass up your question or even ask for it to be removed. The post itself was also downvoted, which most users will do if they feel it is a poorly asked question.


## How Does One Ask *smart* Questions?

Well, it's not about which questions you ask, it's about *how* you ask them. 
Here are some tips, according to Eric, to help you ask your questions in the best way possible.

>1. Have an appropriate and detailed description of your question or problem
>2. Make it very easy for others to reply to you
>3. Make sure your text is grammatically correct and free of spelling errors
(this ensures that no mix-ups due to spelling mishaps or language occur)
>4. Explain your goal with your program, don't list off steps
>5. List your hardware and software details

 ## "Well, Show Me a Smart Question Example!"
 
*Ask and you shall recieve!*

In this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java/513839#513839), a user asks a simple question of "How to compare strings in Java". The user briefly mentions techniques they used, and asked about information on them. The user went straignt to the point, didn't waste time, and also made it clear that they tried their own solutions first. The tags of the post are all related to the question itself and won't overlap in other searches. Many users replied to this post with great answers! It even became a **community effort** post, meaning StackOverflow will use it to direct others to as an official answer. 

Can you spot the differences between this post and the previously mentioned?

Now that you've seen examples of both smart and not-so-smart questions, how will you ask for advice? 
Asking smart questions to get smart answers is how you become a smart developer!
